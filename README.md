# Projet_python_Classification_Spam

The project consists analyzing a dataset called spambase which contains  58 variables and 4601 observations.

After analyzing it, there is one feature called 'class' which tell us if the mail is a spam or not and the other 57 show us the frequency of each feature present in the email entered.
The task here is to open our flask application, enter a mail then submit it.
After typing you email and submitting it, a message will display to tell you if your email is a spam or not.
The prediction of if it's a spam or not is based on our different models built in our program after analyzing the dataset and we choose the best model with the highest accuracy score so that the prediction is as accurate as possible.
